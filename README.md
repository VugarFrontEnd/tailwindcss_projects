# tailwindcss_projects
 
This repository is solely intended for Tailwind Projects. The projects posted inside this repository are a subject to further changes if deemed necessary at any time in the future. The repository is divided in two: TailwindCSS Mini Projects and TailwindCSS Large Projects. For mini projects, Content Delivery Network [CDN] is used while for relatively larger projects, I used Command-Line Interface [CLI]. The designs are mainly borrowed from uidesigndaily.com
